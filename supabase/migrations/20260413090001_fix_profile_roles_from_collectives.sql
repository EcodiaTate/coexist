-- Fix profiles.role to match collective role for non-manager/admin users.
-- The old national_leader → leader migration over-promoted everyone.
-- Under the unified system, profiles.role should match the user's
-- actual collective role, not the inflated global role.
--
-- Rule: for users who are manager or admin, keep that role.
-- For everyone else, use their highest collective role.
