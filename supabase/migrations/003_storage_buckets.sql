-- Helper: owner check reused across buckets. Owner is determined by
-- the first folder segment matching auth.uid().

/* ================================================================== */
-- Supabase image transforms are configured at the project level in the
-- dashboard (Settings → Storage → Image Transformations → Enable).
-- They don't require SQL — transforms are applied via URL params at
-- request time:
--
--   /storage/v1/render/image/public/{bucket}/{path}?width=W&height=H&quality=Q
--
-- Standard sizes used in the app (see src/lib/image-utils.ts):
--
--   Thumbnail:  width=200,  height=200,  quality=80
--   Medium:     width=600,  height=600,  quality=80
--   Large:      width=1200, height=1200, quality=80
--
-- To enable: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Storage → toggle
-- "Enable image transformations". No additional SQL is needed.
