/**
 * Canonical "spots taken" semantics for an event - the single source of truth
 * every surface must agree with.
 *
 * Co-Exist tracks event participation across two tables with two status enums:
 *   - event_tickets.status    = pending | confirmed | cancelled | refunded | checked_in   (the BUYING layer)
 *   - event_registrations.status = invited | registered | attended | cancelled            (the RSVP layer)
 *
 * The banner ("X/Y spots filled") historically counted the RSVP layer (via the
 * event_going_count RPC) while the leader ticket-sales panel counted the buying
 * layer. For a TICKETED event those are two different populations, so the two
 * surfaces disagreed (Myall Park: 25 going vs 22 valid tickets). This module
 * pins ONE definition so no surface can drift again.
 *
 * A taken SPOT (capacity occupancy) is not the same as PAID revenue: a free
 * (price_cents = 0) or full-comp ticket still occupies a seat and counts here.
 * Whether money was actually taken is answered against Stripe, never inferred
 * from a status column.
 *
 * The authoritative count lives server-side in the `event_spots_taken` RPC
 * (SECURITY DEFINER, RLS-independent). These pure helpers exist so client code
 * counts identically wherever it already holds the rows (the leader sales
 * summary, ticket-type remaining) and so the ticketed/non-ticketed decision is
 * written down in exactly one place.
