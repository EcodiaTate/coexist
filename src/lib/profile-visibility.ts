/**
 * Profile visibility tiers - participant profile privacy gating.
 *
 * Origin: Tate directive 29 Apr 2026 20:05 AEST. Non-leaders must NOT see
 * semi-sensitive or fully-sensitive information about other users on
 * profile pages (chat avatar tap modal, /profile/:userId route).
 *
 * The DB security boundary lives in get_user_profile_v1() RPC
 * (migration 079). This helper is the matching client-side check, used as
 * defense-in-depth so the UI explicitly hides sections for non-staff
 * viewers and renders [redacted] placeholders where appropriate.
 *
 * Staff-tier roles (CAN see sensitive info):
 *   - assist_leader, co_leader, leader
 *   - national_leader, manager, admin
 * Non-staff roles (CANNOT see sensitive info):
 *   - participant
