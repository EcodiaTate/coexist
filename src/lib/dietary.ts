 *  emergency contact, so duty-of-care applies to them exactly as it does to a

 *
 *  RE-EXPORTED, not re-typed. This was a hand-written literal until
 *  2026-09-06, which meant the safety gate and the ticket-lifecycle code held
 *  two independent answers to "which statuses are live" and nothing compared
 *  them. The literal failed CLOSED: a seventh status added to the DB enum
 *  would have been silently exempt from the safety gate until someone
 *  remembered this second list. event-capacity.ts DERIVES the set as
 *  TICKET_STATUSES minus TERMINAL_GONE_TICKET_STATUSES, so it fails OPEN (an
 *  unrecognised status counts as a live seat, which is the correct direction
 *  for a duty-of-care gate), and its Deno twin is drift-tested against it.
 *  Re-exporting inherits both guarantees. src/test/safety-gate-coverage.test.ts
 *  asserts the two modules hand back the SAME OBJECT, so reverting this to a
 *  literal fails the build rather than quietly regrowing the fork. */

 *  puts a blocking modal in front of those 264 people, most of them registered
 *  for a two-hour beach clean-up, and what Co-Exist asks of a clean-up
 *  registrant is Co-Exist's call. A camp-out is the case this codebase already
